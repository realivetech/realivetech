Welcome to Realive Technologies GITHUB

Here you'll find projects and tutorials on a variety of topics.

In the spirit of Open Source, Free as in Beer and Free as in Freedom, Public repos are provided under [open source license type?], unless otherwise noted.
Repos that contain more limited license software are subject to the terms of that software. I've tried *not* to include closed source tools and software. 
Correct and respectful attribution is very much appreciated.

Also in the spirit of Open Source, comments and suggestions are welcome and encouraged. I'll review pull and branch requests as needed.
